are there any blatant grammar mistakes?:
Good morning,
Today I will be talking about the American Dream as a source of tragedy in "of Mice and Men".

"Of Mice and Men" is a fictional novel written by John Steinbeck. It was written and is set during the Great Depression and follows the story of two migrant American labourers and lifelong friends, George Milton and Lennie Smalls.

Despite his name, Lennie as a huge and enourmously strong man, but he thinks and acts like a child due to an intelectual disability.
George is Lennie's exact opposite, small and quick witted.
Together, they travel around in search of jobs to earn money so that they can achieve their American Dream.

The American Dream is an idea and concept used consistently throughout the book. It refers to the characters' big goal/dream and is what drives the characters forwards.
In terms of George and Lennie, their American Dream is to "have a little house and a couple of acres an' a cow and some pigs" and "live off the fatta the lan'".
Lennie is especially excited about tending to the rabbits, a point brought up many times. While the American Dream might sound like a beautiful thing, it is also the source of a great deal of the tragedy throughout the story, though not always directly. Primarily, the tragedy comes in the form of loneliness, to which a nod is given through the town of "Soledad", which is spanish for "Loneliness".

Perhaps the loneliest character in "of Mice and Men" is Crooks.

Crooks is a black stable buck on the ranch and experiences extreme racism and loneliness, evident from the line "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.".
Crooks is isolated both socially and physically, he doesn't even have his quarters in the same building as everyone else.
During the story, it is shown that Crooks doesn't really have a dream; the result of them repeatedly getting crushed.
For a short amount of time, Crooks regains a little hope, just for it to be shut down again just like every previous time by a reality check from Curley's wife; "I could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny.".

In his American Dream, Crooks imagined a place of security and belonging-escaping the loneliness, but has had his dream crushed so many times he has just stopped dreaming entirely.
This makes the loneliness tragic, and in turn the American Dream a source of tragedy, as it directly links to loneliness.

Another less obvious example of a character experiencing loneliness is George.
While at a first glance it seems he should be lonely as he has Lennie, it slowly becomes clear that he isn't very content.
While he is friends with Lennie, Lennie is more of a burden then a friend due to his stupidity. "Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world.".
Because of Lennie's intelectual disability, George and Lennie have to constantly keep moving around, and can't stay in the same place for too long because Lennie will go off and accidently do something like he did in Weed.
This resulted in George and Lennie getting run out of Weed. While not stated directly, it is safe to assume that similar things have happened quite a few times before.
George is tired of running. (which is evident from the line) "I could get along so easy and so nice if I didn‚Äôt have you on my tail. I could live so easy and maybe have a girl.".
During the story, every time Lennie does something wrong he asks George if he can still tend to the rabbits. When he asks this, he is refering to the dream that he and George share.
Throughout the story, it is clear George doesn't really believe in the dream at all, until Candy joins them.
Candy is an old ranch worker who lost his hand in an accident. Candy is also a lonely fellow, all he had was his dog, but another ranch worker convinced Candy to let him shoot it.
Shortly after his dog is shot, Candy overhears George and Lennie talking about their dream and asks to join them.
At first George is skeptical, but when Candy tells him that he has $350 to put in George is sold.
"S'pose I went in with you guys. Tha's three hunderd an' fifty bucks I'd put in.".
Finally George starts to realise that his dream might become reality. "This thing they had never really believed in was coining true.".
The three of them have found a plan to settle down somewhere where they will all belong and wont have to be scared of being useless, but then Lennie makes a blunder.
Lennie kills Curley's wife.
Lennie was talking to Curley's wife, and she let him touch her hair. Being unable to contain his strength, he hurt her. She tried to call out for help, but Lennie covered her nose and mouth and shook her snapping her neck, not only killing her but also killing the dream.
Lennie runs away as George instructed him to and waits where the story started. Meanwhile, a manhunt has started to find and lynch Lennie. George naturally finds Lennie first and then does the unthinkable.
He shoots Lennie.
He shoots Lennie not out of hate, spite, anger, frustration, pain, or resentment, but out of love.
He kills Lennie out of love to stop him from getting killed by people who don't have any love for him.
He kills Lennie out of love to stop him from getting tortured.
He kills Lennie out of love to make sure he dies happy.
And along with Lennie, he kills his final chance to make the dream come true, his childhood friend, and his lifelong companion.

When George kills Lennie, he accepts that the dream is over and he has no chance of getting it back. Part of him is tired of the same events happening over and over again, and part of him might hope that life will be easier without the burden of Lennie.
The killing of Lennie is tragic, because he is also killing his own American Dream.
This is why George is also a victim of tragedy.

John Steinbecks "Of Mice and Men" is a 1937 novel set in the Great Depression. It follows George Milton and Lennie Smalls and explores the themes of isolation and tragedy.
In the story, the characters all have their own ambitious and likely naive dreams; their own American Dream.
In the end, "Of Mice and Men" shows us that the American Dream, while full of hope, can also be a source of tragedy and destruction-not because you don't try, but because life isn't fair.

Thank you for listening.

Your writing is strong and well-organized, and it effectively communicates your points. That said, there are several blatant grammar issues and a few style and clarity problems. Below is a detailed review with corrections and suggestions, grouped by type:

‚úÖ Major Grammar and Spelling Fixes
Here are the more serious or glaring issues to correct:

Capitalization of ‚ÄúOf Mice and Men‚Äù

‚ùå "of Mice and Men"
‚úÖ "Of Mice and Men" (Title case)

Spelling:

‚ùå enourmously ‚Üí ‚úÖ enormously

‚ùå intelectual ‚Üí ‚úÖ intellectual

‚ùå refering ‚Üí ‚úÖ referring

‚ùå coining true ‚Üí ‚úÖ coming true

Subject-Verb Agreement and Sentence Fragments:

‚ùå "Lennie as a huge and enourmously strong man..."
‚úÖ "Lennie is a huge and enormously strong man..."

‚ùå "George is tired of running. (which is evident from the line)..."
‚úÖ "George is tired of running, which is evident from the line..."

Punctuation:

‚ùå Spanish should be capitalized in "which is spanish for Loneliness" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "which is Spanish for 'Loneliness'."

‚ùå "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.".
Double punctuation. ‚úÖ "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."

‚ùå "This thing they had never really believed in was coining true.".
Extra period. ‚úÖ "This thing they had never really believed in was coming true."

"Then" vs "Than"

‚ùå "more of a burden then a friend"
‚úÖ "more of a burden than a friend"

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt‚Äù spelling:

‚úÖ "won't have to be scared"

Steinbeck‚Äôs name:

‚ùå "John Steinbecks 'Of Mice and Men'"
‚úÖ "John Steinbeck‚Äôs *Of Mice and Men*"

üõ†Ô∏è Stylistic & Clarity Improvements
These aren't strictly grammar issues but would make your writing stronger:

"It was written and is set during..."
You could simplify this for flow:
‚úÖ "It is set during the Great Depression..." (the writing date is less important in this context)

Avoid repetition of ‚Äúhe kills Lennie out of love‚Ä¶‚Äù
Instead of repeating that line, use varied phrasing to build effect:

‚úÖ "He kills Lennie to spare him from a violent end. He kills him to protect him. He kills him so that Lennie‚Äôs last thoughts are peaceful."

‚ÄúJust for it to be shut down again...‚Äù
Consider a more formal structure:
‚úÖ "...only for it to be shut down again..."

"George naturally finds Lennie first and then does the unthinkable."
Consider:
‚úÖ "...and ultimately does the unthinkable."

Ending line suggestion (optional but effective):

‚úÖ "In the end, Of Mice and Men shows us that the American Dream can inspire hope‚Äîbut also lead to heartbreak and tragedy when dreams are crushed by reality."

Yes‚Äîthis is quite good overall, especially for a speech or class presentation. Your argument is clear, coherent, and thoughtful, and you‚Äôve identified key examples from the text. However, there are still a few grammar issues, clarity problems, and style tweaks that would help make this cleaner and more professional.

‚úÖ Key Fixes You Should Make
1. ‚ÄúLennie Smalls‚Äù
‚úÖ The character's name is Lennie Small (not Smalls).

2. Punctuation Fixes
Periods after quotes:

‚ùå "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.".
‚úÖ "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."

Same issue here:
‚ùå "Tha's three hunderd an' fifty bucks I'd put in.".
‚úÖ "Tha's three hunderd an' fifty bucks I'd put in."

Dashes:

‚ùå "belonging-escaping"
‚úÖ "belonging ‚Äî escaping" (or rephrase: "belonging, escaping...")

Run-on sentence:

‚ùå "and shook her snapping her neck"
‚úÖ "and shook her, snapping her neck"

3. Spelling and Word Choice
‚ùå "accidently"
‚úÖ "accidentally"

‚ùå "quick witted"
‚úÖ "quick-witted"

‚ùå "realise" (technically correct in British English, but you‚Äôve mostly used American conventions)
‚úÖ "realize" ‚Äî for consistency if you're in a U.S. school.

‚ùå "hunderd" (This is okay if you're quoting the character's dialect, but otherwise:)
‚úÖ "hundred" (unless it's a direct quote, then keep as-is)

4. Awkward or Wordy Phrases
Here are smoother alternatives to tighten your writing:

‚ùå "an idea and concept used consistently throughout the book"
‚úÖ "a recurring theme throughout the book"

‚ùå "in search of jobs to earn money so that they can achieve their American Dream"
‚úÖ "searching for work to save money and achieve their American Dream"

‚ùå "only for it to be shut down again just like every previous time"
‚úÖ "only for it to be crushed again, like every time before"

üõ†Ô∏è Revised Sample Paragraph
Here‚Äôs a cleaned-up version of one of your middle paragraphs to show how small edits can make a big difference:

Another less obvious example of a character experiencing loneliness is George.
While at first it may seem that he shouldn't be lonely because he has Lennie, it gradually becomes clear that he isn‚Äôt content.
Although they are friends, Lennie is more of a burden than a companion due to his mental disability.
As George says, "Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world."
Because of Lennie's actions and intellectual disability, they constantly have to move from place to place‚Äîunable to settle down because trouble always follows.
This is shown by their forced escape from Weed.
George is tired of running, which is evident when he says, "I could get along so easy and so nice if I didn‚Äôt have you on my tail. I could live so easy and maybe have a girl."
Throughout the story, whenever Lennie messes up, he asks George if he can still tend the rabbits, reminding us of their shared dream.
But it‚Äôs clear that George never truly believes in the dream‚Äîuntil Candy joins them.

üí¨ Final Verdict
‚úÖ Strengths:

Strong understanding of theme and character.

Well-organized and flows logically.

Appropriate quotes used effectively.

‚ö†Ô∏è To fix before submitting or presenting:

A handful of grammar, punctuation, and word choice issues.

Fix "Lennie Smalls" ‚Üí "Lennie Small"

Smooth out 1‚Äì2 awkward phrasings for clarity and impact.

Would you like me to send back a fully edited version of the entire speech with everything fixed in place?
