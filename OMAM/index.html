Good morning,
Today I will be talking about the American Dream as a source of tragedy in "Of Mice and Men".

"Of Mice and Men" is a fictional novel written by John Steinbeck. It is set during the Great Depression and follows the story of two migrant American labourers and lifelong friends, George Milton and Lennie Small.

Despite his name, Lennie is a huge man, but he thinks and acts like a child due to an intellectual disability.
George is Lennie's exact opposite, small and quick-witted.
Together, they travel around searching for work to save money and achieve their American Dream.

The American Dream is a recurring theme throughout the book. It refers to the characters' big goal and is what drives the characters forwards.
In terms of George and Lennie, their American Dream is to "have a little house and a couple of acres an' a cow and some pigs" and "live off the fatta the lan'".
Lennie is especially excited about tending to the rabbits, a point brought up many times. While the American Dream might sound like a beautiful thing, it is also the source of a great deal of the tragedy throughout the story, though not always directly. Primarily, the tragedy comes in the form of loneliness, to which a nod is given through the town of "Soledad", which is Spanish for "Loneliness".

Perhaps the loneliest character in "Of Mice and Men" is Crooks.

Crooks is a black stable buck on the ranch and experiences extreme racism and loneliness, evident from the line "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.".
Crooks is isolated both socially and physically, he doesn't even have his quarters in the same building as everyone else.
During the story, it is shown that Crooks doesn't really have a dream; the result of them repeatedly getting crushed.
For a short amount of time, Crooks regains a little hope, only for it to be crushed again, like every time before by a reality check from Curley's wife; "I could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny.".

In his American Dream, Crooks imagined a place of security and belonging-escaping the loneliness, but has had his dream crushed so many times he has just stopped dreaming entirely.

Another less obvious example of a character experiencing loneliness is George.
While at a first glance it seems he should be lonely as he has Lennie, it slowly becomes clear that he isn't very content.
While he is friends with Lennie, Lennie is more of a burden than a friend due to his stupidity. "Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world.".
Because of Lennie's intellectual disability, George and Lennie have to constantly keep moving around, and can't stay in the same place for too long because Lennie will go off and accidentally do something like he did in Weed.
While not stated directly, it is safe to assume that similar things have happened quite a few times before.
George is tired of running which is evident from the line "I could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I could live so easy and maybe have a girl.".
Throughout the story, it is clear George doesn't really believe in the dream at all, until Candy joins them.
Candy is an old ranch worker who lost his hand in an accident. Candy is also a lonely fellow, all he had was his dog, but another ranch worker convinced Candy to let him shoot it.
Shortly after his dog is shot, Candy overhears George and Lennie talking about their dream and asks to join them.
At first George is skeptical, but when Candy tells him that he has $350 to put in George is sold.
"S'pose I went in with you guys. Tha's three hundred an' fifty bucks I'd put in.".
Finally George starts to realise that his dream might become reality. "This thing they had never really believed in was coming true.".
The three of them have found a plan to settle down somewhere where they will all belong and won't have to be scared of being useless, but then Lennie makes a blunder.
Lennie kills Curley's wife.
Lennie was talking to Curley's wife, and she let him touch her hair. Being unable to contain his strength, he hurt her. She tried to call out for help, but Lennie covered her nose and mouth and shook her, snapping her neck, not only killing her, but also killing his dream.
Lennie runs away as George instructed him to and waits where the story started. Meanwhile, a manhunt has started to find and lynch Lennie. George finds Lennie where he told him to hide and does the unthinkable.
He shoots Lennie.
He shoots Lennie not out of hate, spite, anger, frustration, pain, or resentment, but out of love.
He kills Lennie out of love to stop him from getting killed by people who don't have any love for him.
He kills Lennie out of love to stop him from getting tortured.
He kills Lennie out of love to make sure he dies happy.
And along with Lennie, he kills his childhood friend, his lifelong companion, and his final chance to make the dream come true.

When George kills Lennie, he accepts that the dream is over and he has no chance of getting it back. Part of him is tired of the same events happening over and over again, and part of him might hope that life will be easier without the burden of Lennie.
The killing of Lennie is tragic, because he is also killing his own American Dream.
This is why George is also a victim of tragedy.

John Steinbeck’s "Of Mice and Men" is a 1937 novel set in the Great Depression. It follows George Milton and Lennie Small and explores the themes of isolation and tragedy.
In the story, the characters all have their own ambitious and likely naive dreams; their own American Dream.
In the end, "Of Mice and Men" shows us how the American Dream, while full of hope, is also a source of tragedy-not at the fault of the dreamer, but at the fault of the unfairness of the world.

Thank you for listening.
